test uiswitch

tested on ios 8.1

When UISwitch is switched several times, its On/Off label status does not concur with status of UISwitch graphical element.
 
Error occures when UISwitch and UITableView are placed on the same screen. If UITableView is not present on the screen, no error occures. The application is run on device without a cord.
